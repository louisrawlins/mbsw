    Gluteus Maximillius : weakspot- butt 

    an orphan who was born to a god and a human. his mother was human and wanted him to be a god like his 
    father not a halfy, so she bathes him in the ambrosia every single day until he bcame immortal and powerful.
    Her hopes were to make him stronger than his father. In the end, Maximillius became immortal and stopped aging
    at the age of 25 and his body was sturdier than titanium, but his birthmark that showed his father was a god was 
    the only part that remained soft. One day, a rival country wages war against his own country for its vast resources
    and his country called on all available young men to fight in the war. Maximillius wanted to prove that he was
    stronger than his father, so he enlists into the army. He trains and gets high recognition, so he ends up being 
    the commander of 30 ships. He is vey proficient with using swords and bow and arrows, his commands were precise
    and his strategies were very witty and flexible. He gains the blessing of one god which makes him sturdy armor
    and weapons, so that he wil be able to prevail in the war. So he sails his 30 ships to engage the enemy in war,
    but one of his ships go astray becuase of sirens. He sends ahead the other ships to the war as reinforcements and 
    supplies and sails his ship to help the ship that went astray. He follows the ship and  There he meets natives 
    that are very hostile and try to kill Maximillius' soldier and take away his supplies. Maximillius fights them 
    and successfully defeats them into submission. He tells half of his 50 member crew to defend the ship while he
    and the other half of his crew go into the island and searches for his missing ship. Him and his crew meets a 
    bunch of monkeys that take away their belongings and they play tag until Maximillius finally catches the monkeys. 
    The crew finally find the missing crew men, but they are being distracted by cute dogs and beautiful sirens. 
    Maximillius braves throught the temptation by (hurting some part of himself ???) strengethening his mind to the 
    fullest. He defeats the Queen of Sirens (the most beautiful, smexy siren. hella beautiful voice. some gods/humans
    would start wars for her if she ever tried to.) by either making a deal with her (idk what deal yet) or defeating 
    her by force. (defeating her by force would mean having the target of all the sirens in the entire 7 seas??).
    After defeating her and getting back his crew, he sets sail to join the war with the rival country. (more obstacles
    if you guys want.) when he arrives to the rival country he immediately starts slaughtering the enemy, proving his 
    ferocious strength !!!!!!! Sir whatshisname come up out of nowhere and almost defeats Maximillius. From that day on 
    they were rivals and they fought on the battlefield multiple times. (somewhere along the way he meets a lover but thats
    a story that i'll add in later. lol) Maximillius accidentally sits on a needle and that really hurt him so he dies. 
    
    Alternate: After much hardship Maximillius finally defeats Sir whatshisname and then goes home in glory. He lives 
    happily ever after with his family and lover and his dog, Persius. 
    
    Alternate: Maximillius dies when Sir whatshisname kills him by accidentally mis-shooting an arrow and he dies by a shot
    in the butt.
